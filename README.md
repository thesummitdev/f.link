# rook

Rook is a open source bookmark service built to provide a performant solution to organize,
tag and search bookmarks. Rook bundles a high throughput transactional database (postgresql)
with a Java API server and lightweight web application.

A docker image will be eventually be provided to self-host the entire application with
little-to-no configuration out of the box.
